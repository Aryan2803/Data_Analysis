### 4. **Feature Selection Methods and High Accuracy ML Model** üß†
   - **Description**: Applied three **feature selection techniques** (Filter, Wrapper, Embedded methods) to the **Breast Cancer dataset**. Implemented a machine learning model that achieved **accuracy above 90%** using a **Random Forest Classifier**.
   - **Key Skills**: Feature Selection (Filter, Wrapper, Embedded)
                     Data Preprocessing (Scaling, Encoding)
                     Machine Learning (Random Forest, Accuracy Improvement)
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, Kaggle datasets.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Preprocessed and scaled the dataset, encoding the target variable.
     2. Applied feature selection:
            Filter: Chi-Square test.
            Wrapper: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
            Embedded: Random Forest feature importance.
     3. Trained a Random Forest model and tuned hyperparameters for over 90% accuracy.
   - **Results**:
      Achieved **90%+ accuracy** using all three feature selection methods.
   - **Dataset**: [Breast Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset)

### 5. **Classification with Decision Tree and Random Forest** üå≤
   - **Description**: In this project, **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest classifiers** were applied to predict outcomes based on the Sales dataset. The goal was to achieve high accuracy with both models and compare their performance. These models were trained, tuned, and evaluated to understand how well they can classify data and predict outcomes in the given sales context.
   - **Key Skills**: Classification, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Model evaluation.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, Kaggle datasets.
   - **Dataset**: [Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nishathakkar/100-sales)
